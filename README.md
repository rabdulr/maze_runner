# The Maze Runner
This project is an exercise in creating a maze algorithm utilizing a very basic stack of jQuery and Javascript. I wanted to be able to automatically generate a maze that is created on the fly with variable controls on how big a maze should be.

Creating this little maze has sparked a curiosity in how algorithms can be utilized as well as seeing how far I can take maze generation.

The maze can be generated through this [demo](https://pensive-tesla-a9a8ee.netlify.app)

# Goals

Ultimately, I want this application to be a place where you can create various types of mazes. Potentially, even try and run through them. How? I don't know yet but it's something I want to explore.

# To Do

- ~~Option for custom grid sizes~~
- Option to slow or increase speed
